# Custom theme website
The website is available [here](https://alkiki.github.io/custome_theme/)

This the webiste where user can change the settings of the webiste: backgorund, font-size, line-height and change font that is user-friendly for dyslexic people. 

The navigation part with all buttons and sliders is created using responsive Bootstrap grid. The color of the background and text was used from this [website](https://randoma11y.com/) so that content is accessible and readable. 
**Packages and frameworks that were used:**
1. Bootstrap

**Future implementations**

I would add more settings that can be modified for a better user experience. (e. g. text to speech function for people with disabilities)
